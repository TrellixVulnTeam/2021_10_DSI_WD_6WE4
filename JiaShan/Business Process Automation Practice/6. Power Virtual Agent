Created a bot using Power Virtual Agents(https://web.powerva.microsoft.com/)
Generated a order status topic, added trigers and customized the bot.
Used Power Automate(https://us.flow.microsoft.com/) to create flows that connects CDS database with the bot.
The bot now can check CDS database and output information regarding order status topic based on customers' input.
The bot will redirect customers to live agents if no match is found in topic triger phrases or CDS database.

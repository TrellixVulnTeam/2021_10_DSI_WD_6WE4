Created Cloud flow using the Moderan Approvals service to automate the request approval workflow.
The flow was created through Power Automate(https://us.flow.microsoft.com/)
Conneted with CDS table and integrated the flow with the Canvas APP "JiaShan_DeivceOrderApp".
Configured the logic process and tested the flow.
The flow allows administrater or manager recieve an automatic notification when a customer put in a requst.
It also enables the administrater or manager to make a decision about the request.
The requestor will recieve an automatic email when a decision is made.
